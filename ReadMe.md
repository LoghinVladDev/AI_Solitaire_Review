This project creates a solitaire game as a way of teaching myself
the basic notions of object-oriented-programming: inheritance, abstraction,
encapsulation and polymorphism.


Definitions:

I. Inheritance

Inheritance is the mechanism that allows one class to acquire all the properties from another class by 
inheriting the class. We call the inheriting class a child class and the inherited class as the superclass 
or parent class.

Java supports single inheritance and multilevel inheritance. This means a class cannot extend from more 
than one class directly, but it can use a hierarchy.



Example:

II. Abstraction

Abstraction is hiding complexities of implementation and exposing simpler interfaces.

If we think about a typical computer, one can only see the external interface, 
which is most essential for interacting with it, while internal chips and circuits are hidden from the user.

In OOP, abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details of a program, 
exposing only the API required to use the implementation. In Java, we achieve abstraction by using 
interfaces and abstract classes.

Example:


III. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is hiding the state or internal representation of an object from the consumer of an API 
and providing publicly accessible methods bound to the object for read-write access. 
This allows for hiding specific information and controlling access to internal implementation.


Example:

IV.Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of an OOP language to process data differently depending on their types of inputs. 
In Java, this can be the same method name having different method signatures and performing different 
functions:
